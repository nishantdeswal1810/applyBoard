# Attempted scrapping using Playwright
* The website is blocking the account and the reason given was too many clicks too fast. To prevent this we have added the delays in filling the details okay!
* The website uses a slider puzzle quite often! Need to explore a way to tackle that

### Current Status
- **login.py** : run this file to automate the login!
- **scrap.py** : run this file to find the course cards on the given url and fetch the name of the universities. This can be improved by adding more information like program name etc.
